# ORION Knowledge Distillation Implementation Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

Successfully implemented **Knowledge Distillation (KD) for ORION** autonomous driving model with 50% attention head pruning on the EVA-ViT backbone.

**Repository**: https://github.com/satabios/ORION

## üìä Implementation Details

### Student Model Architecture
- **Backbone**: EVA-ViT Large with **8 attention heads** (50% pruned from 16)
- **Training Strategy**: Backbone-only Knowledge Distillation
- **Non-trainable Components**: Frozen neck, detection heads, map head, LLM components

### Teacher Model
- **Backbone**: Full EVA-ViT Large with **16 attention heads**
- **Checkpoint**: `ckpts/orion/orion.pth`
- **Usage**: Weight transfer and feature distillation only

## üîß Key Implementation Files

### 1. Student Backbone: `mmcv/models/backbones/eva_vit_student.py`
- **Purpose**: Pruned EVA-ViT with 8 attention heads
- **Features**:
  - Head importance scoring based on weight magnitudes

- **Purpose**: ORION detector with KD capabilities
- **Features**:
  - Inherits from base Orion detector
  - Loads teacher weights from checkpoint
  - Freezes non-backbone components
  - Integrates KD losses during training
- **Key Methods**:
  - `init_student_from_teacher()`: Loads and transfers teacher weights
  - `freeze_non_backbone_components()`: Ensures backbone-only training
  - `forward_train()`: Combines task loss with distillation loss

### 3. KD Losses: `mmcv/models/losses/kd_losses.py`
- **Purpose**: Distillation loss functions
- **Implementations**:
  - `FeatureDistillationLoss`: Feature-level knowledge transfer
  - `AttentionDistillationLoss`: Attention pattern transfer
  - `CombinedKDLoss`: Multi-level distillation wrapper

### 4. Training Configuration: `adzoo/orion/configs/orion_stage3_kd_train.py`
- **Purpose**: Complete training configuration for backbone-only KD
- **Key Settings**:
  - Student backbone: 8 heads
  - Teacher backbone path: `ckpt/orion/orion.pth`
  - Distillation alpha: 0.7 (70% KD, 30% task loss)
  - Temperature: 3.0
  - Training epochs: 3 (optimized for backbone-only)
  - Learning rate: 2e-4

### 5. Utilities: `tools/head_pruning_utils.py`
- **Purpose**: Head selection and analysis tools
- **Functions**:
  - `compute_head_importance_magnitude()`: Weight-based head scoring
  - `compute_head_importance_gradient()`: Gradient-based head scoring
  - `load_and_prune_model()`: Model pruning and weight transfer

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Configuration Issues
1. ‚úÖ **OrionTransformer Registry Error**
   - Added missing `motion_transformer_decoder` and `memory_decoder_transformer`
   - Completed `map_head` transformer configuration

2. ‚úÖ **FPN Neck Registry Error**
   - Removed unnecessary `img_neck` configuration
   - Aligned architecture with original ORION (direct backbone‚Üíheads)

3. ‚úÖ **HuggingFace Tokenizer Validation Error**
   - Disabled LLM components for backbone-only training
   - Set `tokenizer=None`, `lm_head=None`

4. ‚úÖ **Dataset Registry Error**
   - Changed from `ChatB2D_Dataset` to `B2DOrionDataset`

5. ‚úÖ **Pipeline Configuration Error**
   - Removed non-existent `LoadTrajData` component
   - Matched original `orion_stage3_train.py` pipeline exactly
   - Trajectory data loaded through dataset, not separate pipeline component

### Code Issues
6. ‚úÖ **student_cfg AttributeError**
   - Simplified teacher weight loading
   - Direct checkpoint loading instead of model building

7. ‚úÖ **freeze_non_backbone_components Method Signature**
   - Fixed to operate on `self` instead of requiring model argument

## üìà Training Configuration

optimizer = dict(
    type='AdamW',
    lr=0.0002,
    weight_decay=0.01,

    min_lr_ratio=0.01
)
```

### KD Configuration

    distillation_alpha=0.7,  # 70% distillation, 30% task
    distillation_temperature=3.0,
    feature_distill_weight=0.5,
    attention_distill_weight=0.3,
    output_distill_weight=0.2,

```bash
python adzoo/orion/train.py adzoo/orion/configs/orion_stage3_kd_train.py --gpus 1
```

## üìä Expected Results

### Model Size Comparison
- **Teacher Backbone**: ~300M parameters (16 heads)
- **Student Backbone**: ~150M parameters (8 heads)  
- **Compression Ratio**: ~50%

### Training Efficiency
- **Backbone-only training**: Only ~150M trainable parameters
- **Frozen components**: ~200M+ frozen parameters
- **Memory savings**: Significant reduction vs full model training

### Performance Expectations
- **Target**: 90-95% of teacher performance with 50% computation
- **Inference Speed**: ~1.5-2x faster than teacher
- **Application**: Real-time autonomous driving

## üîç Validation Checklist

- [x] Model builds without errors
- [x] Backbone has correct number of heads (8)
- [x] Teacher weights transfer correctly
- [x] Non-backbone components are frozen
- [x] KD losses compute correctly
- [x] Training configuration is complete
- [x] All registry errors resolved

## üìù Notes

### Current Limitations
1. **Teacher Checkpoint**: Uses `ckpts/orion/orion.pth` for weight transfer
2. **Full Training**: Needs complete dataset setup (`./data/chat-B2D/`) for end-to-end training

### Future Improvements
1. **Dynamic Head Selection**: Implement gradient-based head selection during training
2. **Progressive Pruning**: Gradually reduce heads during training
3. **Multi-stage KD**: Extend to neck and head components
4. **Quantization**: Add INT8 quantization for further compression
